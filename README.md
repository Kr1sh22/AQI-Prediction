# Air Quality Analysis in Indian Cities (Hourly Data)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **hourly air quality data of Indian cities** to study pollution trends, AQI behavior, and the impact of major pollutants. The analysis is performed using the **city_hour.csv** dataset from Kaggle, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Air Quality Data in India  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **File Used:** `city_hour.csv`  
- **Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india  

The dataset contains hourly air quality measurements across multiple Indian cities, including AQI values and key pollutants.

## 🧪 Dataset Features
- City
- DateTime (hourly)
- AQI (Air Quality Index)
- Pollutants:
  - PM2.5
  - PM10
  - NO₂
  - SO₂
  - CO
  - O₃

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and missing value handling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- City-wise AQI comparison  
- Hourly pollution trend analysis  
- Pollutant-wise contribution analysis  
- Data visualization for insights  

## 📊 Key Insights
- AQI levels vary significantly across cities  
- Certain hours show consistent pollution peaks  
- PM2.5 and PM10 are the dominant pollutants affecting AQI  
- Metropolitan cities generally record higher AQI levels
